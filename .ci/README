Matrix build:
-------------
We are building our software on different distributions with the help of docker images. Right now
we are using multiple versions of Ubuntu, Fedora and openSUSE.

OSX build:
----------
We are using the OSX support of Travis CI to build EFL on OSX.


Semaphore CI:
-------------
The service uses Ubuntu 14.04 LTS as his base so all our builds are run within docker on it. They do
not offer a config file in the git repo to be parsed which means our configuration sits in their
web ui.


Run locally:
------------
For easy developer testing the CI setup can also be run in full or only parts locally on the
developers machine. You need to have docker installed and after that it is a simple:

docker pull fedora:26
docker build -f .ci/Dockerfile-Fedora26 .


TODO
